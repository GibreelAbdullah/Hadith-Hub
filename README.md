# HADITH HUB (حديث حب)

With the name of Allah, the All-Merciful, the Very-Merciful.

All praise and thanks are due to Allah, the Master and King of existence, the All-Merciful, Beneficent, who has power over all things. May peace and blessings be upon His final Messenger, Sayyidina Muhammad ﷺ, and his Family, and his Companions.
About

HadithHub.com started in October 2022. It aims to make it easy for anyone to read, study, and learn the ahadith of Sayyidina Rasulullah ﷺ. This project is open source.

This repo is the frontend of the hadithhub.com, the data is in the [hadith-api](https://github.com/GibreelAbdullah/hadith-api) repo. We will be grateful if you contribute in this project to make it better.

It would be a grave injustice to omit the mention of [Fawaz Ahmed](https://github.com/fawazahmed0) who made the enormous effort in collecting Ahadith in multiple languages and their gradings by multiple scholars. This project wouldn't be possible without his efforts. May Allah ﷻ reward him immensely.
